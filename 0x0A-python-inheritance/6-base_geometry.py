"""
BaseGeometry module.

This module defines an abstract base class BaseGeometry. The class contains
a public instance method `area()` that raises an exception with the message
'area() is not implemented'. This serves as a placeholder to be overridden
by subclasses that represent specific geometric shapes.

An empty class BaseGeometry is also provided to serve as a foundation for
other geometric shapes.
